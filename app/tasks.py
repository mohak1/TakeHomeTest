    Task 1 consists of the following prompts:
        a. Compute the average time of hottest daily temperature (over month)
        b. Find the most commonly occurring hottest time
        c. Find the Top Ten hottest times on distinct days, sorted by date

    All of these prompts can be answered by finding out the highest
    temperature for each day and the time when that temperature occurred

    For this information, we can look at one date at a time and store
    the highest temperature and the time of highest temperature for that
    date.

    This function collects the highest temperature and time of highest
    temperature for each date and stores it in the `result` dict.
    The `result` dict is passed as a parameter which contains the result
    of task_1 on pervious chunks. The task is performed in the current
    data chunk and the result is updated in the dict. This dict is
    returned by the function so that the tasks can be performed using a
    distributed task queue like Celery

    Forecasts “Outside Temperature” for the first 9 days of the
    next month (i.e. July), assuming that:
    a. The average daily temperature of July is 25
    b. The daily pattern of temperatures for July is the same as June.
    For instance, the pattern on July 1 is the same as the pattern on
    June 1, and so on.

    Approach:
    To forecast 1st July using values of 1st June given that the average
    on 1st July is constant, the pattern can be copied as deviation from
    the mean. That is, we can compute the average temp on 1st June and
    then compute the percentage difference of each value from the mean.
    This percentage can be used for 1st July.

    >>> Example:
    Assuming that the computed average day temp on 1st June was 10 the
    temperature values can be used to calculate percentage difference:
    time    temp    perct_diff
    00:00   10      0.0
    00:10   12      2.0
    00:20   08      -2.0  (and so on)

    This perct_diff values can be used for 1st July as follows:
    time   perct_diff(from June)  avg  forecast=avg+(avg*perct_diff)
    00:00  0.0                    25   25
    00:10  2.0                    25   25.5
    00:20  -2.0                   25   24.5

    Since the data is read in chunks, some forecasted values will be
    less accurate than others since it's possible that a chunk can
    contain partial values of a day, i.e.
        chunk `i` contains 00:00 to 15:50
        chunk `i+1` contains 16:00 to 23:50

    This limitation can handled by collecting the values until all
    the time ranges of all days (from 1st to 9th June) have been
    collected and only then proceeding with the forecast operation.
